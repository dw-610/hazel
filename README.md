The purpose of this project is to create a tool that can process academic articles and their related metadata (e.g., bibtex entries) and create markdown notes that already have useful link information and can be directly added to an obsidian vault.

## Tasks

- Starting simple:
  - Read in a Bibtex entry
  - Create a markdown file with the title as the name in Pascal Case
  - Make the title of the paper the main heading of the document
  - Create an authors section and list the authors as [[links]]
